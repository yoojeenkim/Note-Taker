# Note-Taker

## Description

For users that want to write and save notes, they can use the Note Taker to organize their thoughts and keep track of tasks. When the user first opens the Note Taker, they will be directed to the landing page with a link to the notes page. When the user clicks the notes button, they will be taken to a page with existing notes on the left-hand side, plus a section to take notes on the right side. If the user clicks the save button at the top right, the contents in the right side will be saved into the left-hand column. If the user clicks the delete trash can button on any of the notes, it will delete the note associated to the button.
